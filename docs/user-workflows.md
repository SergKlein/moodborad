# User Workflows

## Overview

This document describes user-facing workflows in the Moodboard platform, focusing on the end-user experience and interaction patterns. Each workflow is designed to provide an intuitive, seamless experience while ensuring robust functionality and data integrity.

## 1. Authentication Flows

The authentication system provides secure and convenient access to the platform while maintaining a smooth user experience. It supports both traditional email/password authentication and OAuth options.

### 1.1 Registration Process

The registration process is invitation-based to ensure controlled platform growth and maintain service quality. This approach helps create an exclusive environment while ensuring high-quality user engagement.

**Process Description:**
1. Users receive a unique invitation code through email
2. The code is validated during registration
3. Users provide essential information and verify their email
4. Profile setup includes basic preferences and initial settings

**Key Considerations:**
- Invitation codes have expiration dates
- Email verification is required
- Password requirements follow security best practices
- Profile information can be completed gradually

        S->>U: Complete Registration
    else Invalid Code
        S->>U: Show Error Message
    end
```

### 1.2 Login Process

The login system provides multiple authentication methods while maintaining security and user convenience. It includes features for both regular users and those using OAuth providers.

**Process Description:**
1. Users can choose between traditional login or OAuth
2. Multiple failed attempts trigger security measures
3. Session management includes remember-me functionality
4. Password recovery options are readily available

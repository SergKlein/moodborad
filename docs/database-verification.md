# Database Verification and Configuration

## Overview

This document outlines the database configuration, verification process, and fixes applied to ensure the database schema is properly set up.

## Database Configuration

The project uses the following database configuration:

- **Database Provider**: PostgreSQL (via Neon.tech)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Connection String**: Stored in `.env` and `.env.development` files as `POSTGRES_URL`
- **Schema Definition**: Located at `./lib/db/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Located at `./lib/db/migrations/`

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Migration Script Error**
   - Issue: The migration script had an error handling query results when checking for existing tables
   - Fix: Updated the script to properly handle and type-check the query results
   - File: `./lib/db/migrations/migrate.ts`

2. **Missing Database Table**
   - Issue: The `customers` table defined in the schema was missing from the database
   - Fix: Generated and applied a new migration to create the missing table
   - Files:
     - New migration: `./lib/db/migrations/0001_jittery_bloodaxe.sql`
     - Schema definition: `./lib/db/schema.ts`

3. **Schema Verification Tool**
   - Issue: No easy way to verify database tables against schema
   - Fix: Created a schema check script that:
     - Lists all tables in the database
     - Compares with expected tables from schema
     - Shows table columns and types
   - File: `./scripts/check-schema.ts`

## Current Database Schema

The database now contains all required tables:

1. **users**
   - User accounts and authentication
   - 8 columns including id, name, email, password_hash, role, timestamps

2. **teams**
   - Team/organization entities
   - 9 columns including id, name, stripe related fields, timestamps

3. **team_members**
   - Relationship between users and teams
   - 5 columns including user_id, team_id, role, joined_at

4. **activity_logs**
   - Audit trail for user/team actions
   - 6 columns including team_id, user_id, action, timestamp, ip_address

5. **invitations**
   - Team invitation tracking
   - 7 columns including team_id, email, role, invited_by, status

6. **customers**
   - Stripe customer data for teams
   - 5 columns including team_id, stripe_customer_id, timestamps

## Available Database Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pnpm run db:setup` | Set up database configuration |
| `pnpm run db:generate` | Generate new migrations from schema changes |
| `pnpm run db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations to database |
| `pnpm run db:seed` | Seed the database with sample data |
| `pnpm run db:studio` | Open Drizzle Studio for database inspection |
| `pnpm run db:reset` | Reset the database |
| `pnpm run db:check` | Verify database schema against expected schema |

## Connecting to the Database

The database connection is configured using the following environment variables:

```
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>/neondb?sslmode=require
```

For local development, this is configured in `.env.development`.

## Conclusion

The database schema has been verified and all tables defined in the schema are now present in the database. The migration scripts have been updated to handle errors more gracefully, and a new schema verification tool has been added to help keep the database schema in sync with the code.
